# Signal Relay
# since v1.4.0, a more reliable, psrpc based signal relay is available
# this gives us the ability to reliably proxy messages between a signal server and RTC node

  # retries use exponentially increasing wait on every subsequent try
  # with an upper bound of max_retry_interval

  # maximum amount of time to wait for RTC node to ack
  max_retry_interval: 5s
  # number of messages to buffer before dropping

# PSRPC
# since v1.5.1, a more reliable, psrpc based internal rpc
psrpc:
  # maximum number of rpc attempts

  timeout: 500s
  # amount of time added to the timeout after each failure
